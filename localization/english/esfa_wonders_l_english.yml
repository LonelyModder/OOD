It is rumored that the Demon King in held inside but the structure is protected both by the local Salgarans and by the curse that prevents anyone from even getting close to the structure. It's the only place in Salgar that annunaki are allowed to visit to check if the spells hold."

 wonder_bloodtree_desc:0 "Enormous tree with red leaves in the middle of dilmun island. Acording to some legends annunaki owe their long lifespan to the tree itself. Tree dies their immortality with it. The only certain thing is that tree is saintient and special group of priests is able to communicate with it to some degree. Since all important celebrations take place in front of it tree also serves as a living chronicle of past events."
 wonder_kuburra:0 "Kaburra Gate"
 wonder_kuburra_desc:0 "The Outer Doors as the Annunaki call them. In the past they allowed the children of anu to quickly move troops from one border of the empire to the next but today even those that work can teleport you in the middle of nowhere. Some tales suggest that with the proper rituals the gates could take you to other worlds. There are records from the times before the starfall where the travelers couldn't recognize the stars. Today thanks to Ekimmu we know that it was possible but since the gates don't work we nay never know for certain."
