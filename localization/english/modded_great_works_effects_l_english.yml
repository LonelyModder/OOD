 gw_effect_wonder_kuburra_DESC:0 "The Outer Doors as the Annunaki call them. In the past they allowed the children of anu to quickly move troops from one border of the empire to the next but today even those that work can teleport you in the middle of nowhere. Some tales suggest that with the proper rituals the gates could take you to other worlds. There are records from the times before the starfall where the travelers couldn't recognize the stars. Today thanks to Ekimmu we know that it was possible but since the gates don't work we nay never know for certain."

 gw_effect_wonder_spearofaten:0 "Spear of Aten"
 gw_effect_wonder_spearofaten_desc:0 "Great Sandstone construction in the middle of the desert. The tower itself is surely made by mortals but no one knows it's origin. The compasses in the vicinity of Sahalgar point in it's direction instead of the north as they should. The locals claim that the tower is the gift of the Aten and forbid the outsiders coming closer. This is one of the holiest places on Sahargal. Every adult medded even those faithfull to Anu from the west must visit the site at least once in his life."
