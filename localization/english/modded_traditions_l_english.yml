 #Traditions

The position itself is hereditary thou anyone believing himself strong enaugh can challenge the leader. He only needs to prove himself to the rest of the clan. The challenged can decide the rules of the competition. If the leader is not mature the challenger must wait till he will be able to fight. This ensures that the clans are led by competent warriors and leaders."
 ekimmu_path_2:0 "Persuit of Power"
 ekimmu_path_2_desc:0 "They are called mages but contrary to what the name suggest they do not throw fireballs left and right. Magaidh's powers are more subtle.

 ekimmu_path_2a:0 "Dragons"
 ekimmu_path_2a_desc:0 "Name Mushusshu is the name given to those creatures by the locals. They were initially brought by Ekimmu as a mounts but during some unknown battle some of them escaped and spread around the Eastern Tilasar. No one except Ekimmu managed to tame them, not because the lack of trying but the races of Nibiru are simply too small and weak for them to gain their respect. Enukku don't so much tame them as create a bridge between mind of a rider and the dragon."
 ekimmu_path_3a:0 "The Banners"
 ekimmu_path_3a_desc:0 "Ekimmu do not use the phalanx since it is not possible to use in mountains, cave and halls where they live.

 ekimmu_path_4a:0 "Dragon Fire"
 ekimmu_path_4a_desc:0 "Dragons fear the fire as all creatures do so the training to ignore it is extremely hard and requires multiple mages. The resul thou is wort it.

At the rider's command, it starts rubbing them while spitting, which ignites the venom."
 ekimmu_path_2c:0 "Living Wepon"
 ekimmu_path_2c_desc:0 "Term used by the Enukku for the result of their experiments. Seeing the Enukku using humans as cannon fodder Ekimmu copied their tactic by kidnaping human wemen and experimenting on them creating the new race as a result. The new race was never meant to be saintient but the devine intervention of Anu gave them life and they subsequently revolted thou many of them still tempted by the conditions and rejected by other races returns to serve their masters now of their onw free will."
 ekimmu_path_2b:0 "Nurage"

 #Traditions
 rabisu_path_1:0 "Dread from Below"
 rabisu_path_1_desc:0 "Arm Beo as they former masters called them thou the name taken from the monster tales for children is also fitting. They do not have horns but like to wear them to battle for psychological effect. Rabisu are stronger than other races and wounds that could have killed a human are mearly a scratch for them. They also share the distaste for the daylight with their Ekimmu creators."
 rabisu_path_2:0 "Green Menace"
 rabisu_path_2_desc:0 "Especially in the visinity of mountain ranges the Rabisu attacks are to be expected. The raiders will take everything that is not nailed to a wall including captives. Sometimes there are even traces of canibalism so at least some tribes practice it."
 rabisu_path_3:0 "Battle Discipline"
 rabisu_path_3_desc:0 "Usually the Rabisu warband looks more like undisciplined mob than an army but the look can be deceiving. When in battle rabisu warriors can even stop mid charge which is hard to pull off of even for most experience warriors. In difficult mountaineous terrain when the battle formations can be easily broken discipline is the key factor in battles."
 rabisu_path_3a:0 "Stamina"
 rabisu_path_3a_desc:0 "Rabisu are well known for the speed with which they march. They do not tire as quickly as other races and can march all day long without a break in full gear. They can only be captured if they are leading prisoners."
 rabisu_path_4a:0 "Poisoned Arrows"
 rabisu_path_4a_desc:0 "Why kill the enemy when you can wound him? The wounded warrior will take away his brother from the fight. This is the way most battles with rabisu starts. Their archers use strong poisons from the plants growing in the underground enviroment. Poisons usually kill target after a long period of enormous pain."
 rabisu_path_5a:0 "Battle Rage"
 rabisu_path_5a_desc:0 "Some of the Rabisu clans are known from making the psychoactive mushroom potions that could be a deadly for a human but help to throw a warrior into an uncontrolled battle frenzy. The drugged warriors often go in the front row to break the enemy formation."
 rabisu_path_3b:0 "Stone Nest"
 rabisu_path_3b_desc:0 "The clans fortresses are usually in caves or hilltops and are well protected against outsiders. Most of the times the entrance is bristling with all kinds of traps. And even after reaching the walls there will be still the matter of defenders. "
 rabisu_path_4b:0 "Experienced Warriors"
 rabisu_path_4b_desc:0 "In most cultures being a soldier is a seasonal task. Rabisu is trained for battle from the day he can weild a spear. Teenagers are often left in a wild after short training to better prepare them to face the hard conditions. After that they are taken under the wings of more experience warriors. Youngling in not ready for battle until he will kill his first enemy."
 rabisu_path_5b:0 "Patience"
 rabisu_path_5b_desc:0 "Rabisu are not experts on siege warfare but their natural resistance protects them from most deseases. They use that ability to spread the plagues into the besieged cities. What will not kill them will surely kill the weaklings behind the stone walls."
 rabisu_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Necessary Evil"
 rabisu_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "From the psychoactive concoctions to biological warfare there are no wepons that rabisu will not use to protect the clan. It seems evil for outsiders but since no one likes them anyway they have no real reason to care. After all they often get the same treatment from their enemies so why not?"

 #####Sahargali
 ######
 sahargali_philosophy:1 "Sahargali Traditions"
 sahargali_philosophydesc:3 "Great Sands are merciless place, the only source of life here are the Nissimu river and the oasis scattered across the desert. For the inhabitants this place is the wepon in itself. Any invading army would have to follow the heavily fortified river or die in sands. Most of them did."
 tradition_unlock_requirement_sahargali:0 "You don't have enough of Salgarans or Meded to unlock the tradition or they are not integrated culture. "
 #Traditions
 sahargali_path_1:0 "Sahargal"
 sahargali_path_1_desc:0 "The desert is the wepon in itself. Without the necessary knowledge and equipment it is impossible to cross it. A lot of armies got simply swollowed without a trace including the annunaki. Sometimes when the desert is mercifull it will uncover the corpses of the unlucky ones that died in it."
 sahargali_path_2:0 "Meded"
 sahargali_path_2_desc:0 "The name Meded has many meanings but is usually connected with the people of the desert. Nomarchs use the meded as scouts and special police force all in one. They use specially trained hounds and are good with throwing sticks."
 sahargali_path_2a:0 "Pharoh's Infantry"
 sahargali_path_2a_desc:0 "Even though most of them come from conscription, salgarans are known to posess the most disciplined infantry in the region. Normal conscripts when surrounded simply run away from the battlefield but not salgarans. They are tought that a running man is simply a bigger target so they form squares and will only yeld when ordered to."
 sahargali_path_3a:0 "Light Chariot."
 sahargali_path_3a_desc:0 "The chariots used by the Salgari and their Meded allies are lighter than that of their western neighbours and look more like the ones used by the Gardu from the north. They need to be carried to battle in pieces and assembled before they can be used. This may be viewed as disadvantage but experienced crew do that in minutes and then chariot is ready. Eastern chariots are often used as mobile pletforms for archers."
 sahargali_path_4a:0 "Sandstone Forts"
 sahargali_path_4a_desc:0 "Since the revolt that overthrew the Shemsu-Hor as Salgari called the Annunaki the Pharoh used the network of fortresses to control the river from the delta to the sources. Most od the costruction was built in no time using the mudbrick. Even after the thousends of years the forts are still able to hold the enemies of the kingdom at bay."
 sahargali_path_5a:0 "Devine Heritage"
 sahargali_path_5a_desc:0 "Pharoh weilds the secular and religious power over his subjects. His very presence on the battlefield raises the morale of soldiers and usually means that the current campaignis important for the kingdoms survival. His orders are treated as if they came from Aten himself."
 sahargali_path_2b:0 "Life in the Desert"
 sahargali_path_2b_desc:0 "The only way to cross the desert is to hop for one oasis to the next so it should beexpected that they are well defended in times of conflict. The defending army usually positions itself between the oasis and attacker. Then the only thing to do is to wait. In most cases the enemy warriors will be weakened by the desert heat and perish or they will surrender."
 sahargali_path_3b:0 "Camels"
 sahargali_path_3b_desc:0 "They are the newest addition to the Pharohs arsenal. They can collect water in the hump on their backs and carry heavier loads than donkeys. Typically a couple of them carries spare arrows so the enemy will have unwelcome surprise when he will find out that the ammunition will not end as quickly as he hoped."
 sahargali_path_4b:0 "Experienced Officers"
 sahargali_path_4b_desc:0 "Most of the kingdoms forces may consist of levies but Pharoh always kept a contingent of veterans so he could react quickly when the needed. The realms borders are long and the desert cannot keep all the kingdoms enemies at bay so where the desert is too weak the experienced soldiers are needed."
 sahargali_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Desert Warriors"
 sahargali_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Thou lightly armoured and consisting of conscripts the armies of Sahargal are not as weak as some may claim. They know the terrain they fight in and they know how to use it to their advantage. The enemy may come but the desert will the desert will swallow him as many others before and after him."
