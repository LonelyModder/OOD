 #Traditions

The position itself is hereditary thou anyone believing himself strong enaugh can challenge the leader. He only needs to prove himself to the rest of the clan. The challenged can decide the rules of the competition. If the leader is not mature the challenger must wait till he will be able to fight. This ensures that the clans are led by competent warriors and leaders."
 ekimmu_path_2:0 "Persuit of Power"
 ekimmu_path_2_desc:0 "They are called mages but contrary to what the name suggest they do not throw fireballs left and right. Magaidh's powers are more subtle.

 ekimmu_path_2a:0 "Dragons"
 ekimmu_path_2a_desc:0 "Name Mushusshu is the name given to those creatures by the locals. They were initially brought by Ekimmu as a mounts but during some unknown battle some of them escaped and spread around the Eastern Tilasar. No one except Ekimmu managed to tame them, not because the lack of trying but the races of Nibiru are simply too small and weak for them to gain their respect. Enukku don't so much tame them as create a bridge between mind of a rider and the dragon."
 ekimmu_path_3a:0 "The Banners"
 ekimmu_path_3a_desc:0 "Ekimmu do not use the phalanx since it is not possible to use in mountains, cave and halls where they live. Instead their armies are composed of units from the minor clans that are led with the use of banners. The standard-bearer has a set of gestures and signals with which he tells the units what to do."
 ekimmu_path_4a:0 "Dragon Fire"
 ekimmu_path_4a_desc:0 "Dragons fear the fire as all creatures do so the training to ignore it is extremely hard and requires multiple mages. The resul thou is wort it. Dragons have natural venom they canspit at a distance of several meters. And that venom is flammable. The dragon has a special material on its teeth that causes sparks. At the rider's command, it starts rubbing them while spitting, which ignites the venom."
 ekimmu_path_2c:0 "Living Wepon"
 ekimmu_path_2c_desc:0 "Term used by the Enukku for the result of their experiments. Seeing the Enukku using humans as cannon fodder Ekimmu copied their tactic by kidnaping human wemen and experimenting on them creating the new race as a result. The new race was never meant to be saintient but the devine intervention of Anu gave them life and they subsequently revolted thou many of them still tempted by the conditions and rejected by other races returns to serve their masters now of their onw free will."

 #Traditions
 rabisu_path_1:0 "Dread from Below"
 rabisu_path_1_desc:0 "Arm Beo as they former masters called them thou the name taken from the monster tales for children is also fitting. They do not have horns but like to wear them to battle for psychological effect. Rabisu are stronger than other races and wounds that could have killed a human are mearly a scratch for them. They also share the distaste for the daylight with their Ekimmu creators."
 rabisu_path_2:0 "Green Menace"
 rabisu_path_2_desc:0 "Especially in the visinity of mountain ranges the Rabisu attacks are to be expected. The raiders will take everything that is not nailed to a wall including captives. Sometimes there are even traces of canibalism so at least some tribes practice it."
 rabisu_path_3:0 "Battle Discipline"
 rabisu_path_3_desc:0 "Usually the Rabisu warband looks more like undisciplined mob than an army but the look can be deceiving. When in battle rabisu warriors can even stop mid charge which is hard to pull off of even for most experience warriors. In difficult mountaineous terrain when the battle formations can be easily broken discipline is the key factor in battles."
 rabisu_path_3a:0 "Stamina"
 rabisu_path_3a_desc:0 "Rabisu are well known for the speed with which they march. They do not tire as quickly as other races and can march all day long without a break in full gear. They can only be captured if they are leading prisoners."
 rabisu_path_4a:0 "Poisoned Arrows"
 rabisu_path_4a_desc:0 "Why kill the enemy when you can wound him? The wounded warrior will take away his brother from the fight. This is the way most battles with rabisu starts. Their archers use strong poisons from the plants growing in the underground enviroment. Poisons usually kill target after a long period of enormous pain."
 rabisu_path_5a:0 "Battle Rage"
 rabisu_path_5a_desc:0 "Some of the Rabisu clans are known from making the psychoactive mushroom potions that could be a deadly for a human but help to throw a warrior into an uncontrolled battle frenzy. The drugged warriors often go in the front row to break the enemy formation."
 rabisu_path_3b:0 "Stone Nest"
 rabisu_path_3b_desc:0 "The clans fortresses are usually in caves or hilltops and are well protected against outsiders. Most of the times the entrance is bristling with all kinds of traps. And even after reaching the walls there will be still the matter of defenders. "
 rabisu_path_4b:0 "Experienced Warriors"
 rabisu_path_4b_desc:0 "In most cultures being a soldier is a seasonal task. Rabisu is trained for battle from the day he can weild a spear. Teenagers are often left in a wild after short training to better prepare them to face the hard conditions. After that they are taken under the wings of more experience warriors. Youngling in not ready for battle until he will kill his first enemy."
 rabisu_path_5b:0 "Patience"
 rabisu_path_5b_desc:0 "Rabisu are not experts on siege warfare but their natural resistance protects them from most deseases. They use that ability to spread the plagues into the besieged cities. What will not kill them will surely kill the weaklings behind the stone walls."
 rabisu_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Necessary Evil"
 rabisu_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "From the psychoactive concoctions to biological warfare there are no wepons that rabisu will not use to protect the clan. It seems evil for outsiders but since no one likes them anyway they have no real reason to care. After all they often get the same treatment from their enemies so why not?"

 #####Sahargali
 ######
 sahargali_philosophy:1 "Sahargali Traditions"
 sahargali_philosophydesc:3 "Great Sands are merciless place, the only source of life here are the Nissimu river and the oasis scattered across the desert. For the inhabitants this place is the wepon in itself. Any invading army would have to follow the heavily fortified river or die in sands. Most of them did."
 tradition_unlock_requirement_sahargali:0 "You don't have enough of Salgarans or Meded to unlock the tradition or they are not integrated culture. "
 #Traditions
 sahargali_path_1:0 "Sahargal"
 sahargali_path_1_desc:0 "The desert is the wepon in itself. Without the necessary knowledge and equipment it is impossible to cross it. A lot of armies got simply swollowed without a trace including the annunaki. Sometimes when the desert is mercifull it will uncover the corpses of the unlucky ones that died in it."
 sahargali_path_2:0 "Meded"
 sahargali_path_2_desc:0 "The name Meded has many meanings but is usually connected with the people of the desert. Nomarchs use the meded as scouts and special police force all in one. They use specially trained hounds and are good with throwing sticks."
 sahargali_path_2a:0 "Pharoh's Infantry"
 sahargali_path_2a_desc:0 "Even though most of them come from conscription, salgarans are known to posess the most disciplined infantry in the region. Normal conscripts when surrounded simply run away from the battlefield but not salgarans. They are tought that a running man is simply a bigger target so they form squares and will only yeld when ordered to."
 sahargali_path_3a:0 "Light Chariot."
 sahargali_path_3a_desc:0 "The chariots used by the Salgari and their Meded allies are lighter than that of their western neighbours and look more like the ones used by the Gardu from the north. They need to be carried to battle in pieces and assembled before they can be used. This may be viewed as disadvantage but experienced crew do that in minutes and then chariot is ready. Eastern chariots are often used as mobile pletforms for archers."
 sahargali_path_4a:0 "Sandstone Forts"
 sahargali_path_4a_desc:0 "Since the revolt that overthrew the Shemsu-Hor as Salgari called the Annunaki the Pharoh used the network of fortresses to control the river from the delta to the sources. Most od the costruction was built in no time using the mudbrick. Even after the thousends of years the forts are still able to hold the enemies of the kingdom at bay."
 sahargali_path_5a:0 "Devine Heritage"
 sahargali_path_5a_desc:0 "Pharoh weilds the secular and religious power over his subjects. His very presence on the battlefield raises the morale of soldiers and usually means that the current campaignis important for the kingdoms survival. His orders are treated as if they came from Aten himself."
 sahargali_path_2b:0 "Life in the Desert"
 sahargali_path_2b_desc:0 "The only way to cross the desert is to hop for one oasis to the next so it should beexpected that they are well defended in times of conflict. The defending army usually positions itself between the oasis and attacker. Then the only thing to do is to wait. In most cases the enemy warriors will be weakened by the desert heat and perish or they will surrender."
 sahargali_path_3b:0 "Camels"
 sahargali_path_3b_desc:0 "They are the newest addition to the Pharohs arsenal. They can collect water in the hump on their backs and carry heavier loads than donkeys. Typically a couple of them carries spare arrows so the enemy will have unwelcome surprise when he will find out that the ammunition will not end as quickly as he hoped."
 sahargali_path_4b:0 "Experienced Officers"
 sahargali_path_4b_desc:0 "Most of the kingdoms forces may consist of levies but Pharoh always kept a contingent of veterans so he could react quickly when the needed. The realms borders are long and the desert cannot keep all the kingdoms enemies at bay so where the desert is too weak the experienced soldiers are needed."
 sahargali_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Desert Warriors"
 sahargali_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Thou lightly armoured and consisting of conscripts the armies of Sahargal are not as weak as some may claim. They know the terrain they fight in and they know how to use it to their advantage. The enemy may come but the desert will the desert will swallow him as many others before and after him."

 ######
 kurgunese_philosophy:1 "Kurgunese Traditions"
 kurgunese_philosophydesc:3 "The Kurgunese are well known from their military prowess. The constant battle for domination between city states forced them to develop many new inventions and strategies to defeat their oponents. After all the only way to become the King of Kings is over the corpses of your enemies."
 tradition_unlock_requirement_kengiri:0 "You don't have enough of Kengiri or Saelgairi to unlock the tradition or they are not integrated culture. "
 #Traditions
 kurgunese_path_1:0 "Dilmunite Tin"
 kurgunese_path_1_desc:0 "The only safe method of producing Bronze is to mix copper with tin. And the only large quantities of that metal in the region are on the isle of Dilmun which is ruled by the Annunaki. Kengiri manage to gain independence by peacefull means and managed to keep the faith in Anu. Thats why they have free access to the Dilmunite tin which raises the quality of their wepons and armour."
 kurgunese_path_2:0 "Heavy Chariot"
 kurgunese_path_2_desc:0 "Kengiri managed to adapt the Gardan chariot to better suit their needs. Instead of focusing on speed and lightness, they focused on shields and penetration. They gave the horses leather armor and reinforced the chariot with bronze joints so that it did not have to be transported and could accompany the army on the march."
 kurgunese_path_2a:0 "Western Phalanx"
 kurgunese_path_2a_desc:0 "By uniting the Enukku tactics with human shield wall kengiri created the new variant of phalanx. The new version of this formation consists of mixed lines of spearmen and archers. Expanding the number of archers in formation helped in dealing with more mobile units. Also new larger shields served as mobile defenses behind which archers could hide during sieges."
 kurgunese_path_3a:0 "National Army"
 kurgunese_path_3a_desc:0 "With the potential enemies on all sides like ekimmu and rabisu mountain strongholds there was a need for more permanent military forces. Now some soldiers stayed in service after the campaign season was over instead of returning to their farms."
 kurgunese_path_2b:0 "Saelgairi"
 kurgunese_path_2b_desc:0 "In the recent years the tribesmen frim the north began migrating south fleeing the famine that hit their homeland. Due to their harsh upbringing their warriors became a common sight in the Kingiri armies. They are talled and stronger than an avarage inhabitant of Kurgun."
 kurgunese_path_3b:0 "Slave Based Economy"
 kurgunese_path_3b_desc:0 "Saelgairi were not only used as a source of capable recruits. They became also a valuable broker in the slave trade with the barbarians to the north. Sometimes they were raiding in the search of slaves themselves but most often they were buying them from the northern warlords for bronze tools and other southern trade goods."
 kurgunese_path_2c:0 "Kings Roads"
 kurgunese_path_2c_desc:0 "Kengiri lived under the rule of Annunaki the longest of all human realms. Mostly because of their piecefull wthdrawal most of the technological achivements managed to survive. Probably the most important of them all is the road network. One of the most important taks set before a Kingiri ruler is maintaining the road network and protecting the traders."
 kurgunese_path_3c:0 "Enukku War Machines"
 kurgunese_path_3c_desc:0 "Enukku engineers accompanying armies are a common sight. Every local ensi wants at least one in his service. They help build and maintain enukkian siege engines. Their mere presence is evidence of their employer big pockets. Also the enukku rarely serve the king they do not respect."
 kurgunese_path_4c:0 "Border Forts"
 kurgunese_path_4c_desc:0 "The White Wall Mountains are long and difficult to defend thats why a series of border fortifications was erected to better protect the Kurgun from constant attacks from Rabisu. Sometimes enemies will find some old tunnel or unknown mountain pass so there is need to built new fortifications. Thats why their construction is rater simple after all they are meant to protect from raids not invasions."
 kurgunese_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Between East and West"
 kurgunese_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Kurgun connects the West, East and the North together and benefits from their influence. The Kurgunese armies hire brutal barbarians, Annunaki engineers and ride eastern chariots to war. The trade brought them here and made this land strong. And only strongest can rule."

 #Traditions
 gardan_path_1:0 "Nomadic chariots"
 gardan_path_1_desc:0 "Steppe is and open terrain where the fastest way to trabel is by using a horse-drawn carriage. The first chariots looked just like that carriages with two axis and two horses pulling the vehicle. Then they started to experiment by reducing the axis to one with only one horse pulling the chariot. "
 gardan_path_2:0 "Female Warriors"
 gardan_path_2_desc:0 "What surprised many who treated with the horse lords for the first time was that the wemen were also armed. Thou they mostly stay at the camp guarding the supplies sometimes you can even see them driving a chariot or in hunting parties. The life on a steppe is brutal and a woman must be able to defend herself."
 gardan_path_2a:0 "Nomadic Raides"
 gardan_path_2a_desc:0 "Gardu can dismantle their mobile cities within hours and move with the speed surprising even the Annunaki. They posess large number of horses that allow them to be fully mobile. This is also true for their raids when they can afford to park their camp outside of the city and wait. If the enemy put up a fight there can be no mercy."
 gardan_path_3a:0 "Tumen"
 gardan_path_3a_desc:0 "During longer campaigns the horde is devided into the divisions numbering more less 10000 men. Every division have their own supplies and command structure and can operate fully independently. The Gardu commanders have large operational freedom."
 gardan_path_4a:0 "Great Khan"
 gardan_path_4a_desc:0 "Every minor Khan or king in terms of the city-dwellers dreams of uniting all tribes under his rule. Shamans prophecised the coming of a ruler who will one day rule all of the continent making the lugals and pharohs bow to him. That achivement will certainly gain the favor of the Sky God and his warriors."
 gardan_path_2b:0 "Practical Violence"
 gardan_path_2b_desc:0 "Gardu may seem brutal and without coincience but one have to remember that they have much smaller numbers than their oponents. They use the violence like human-sields or tortures as a wepon against their enemies. Every city that will capitulate is fiew dead warriors less."
 gardan_path_3b:0 "Harsh Training"
 gardan_path_3b_desc:0 "The horde is more inclusive than one may suspect. Basically everyone can join if he manages to convince the khan of his worth. Yet only the ones that fulfill the requirements can ride with the warriors. The training is hard and brutal but warriors gain the most respect and plunder. One of the more horrifying practices is killing the animal (usually cat, dog or a lamb) you got on the first day of training to teach you how to kill."
 gardan_path_2c:0 "Talented Men"
 gardan_path_2c_desc:0 "After the city is sacked every prisoner is evaluated based on his skills. Engineers are usually the most wanted.

 gardan_path_3c:0 "Throu the Steppe"
 gardan_path_3c_desc:0 "The Central Planes are one of the trade routes leading from the western coast to the east and vast amounts of trade goods travel throu every year. Khans make sure that traders can travel safely throu their lands(after paying them for it of course)."

 #Traditions
 nuban_path_1:0 "Long Bows"
 nuban_path_1_desc:0 "By use of the special tropical tree growing in the south the Nubans managed to strengthen their bows and extend their range significantly. Beside this new development the southerners are share the title of the best archers with Annunaki. They volley fire tactic has proven to be very effective even against chariots. "
 nuban_path_1a:0 "The Barrim Wastes"
 nuban_path_1a_desc:0 "Barrim Wastes are the southern part of great Sahargal Desert and serve as a natural wall deviding south and the land of the pharoh's. Nubans launch invasions from time to time crossing the desert, especially in it's eastern section. Some tribes deside to stay near the oasis and many of them are trading with the local Meded."
 nuban_path_2a:0 "Wepon of the Enemy"
 nuban_path_2a_desc:0 "The Nuban tribesmen always feared the chariots. These fast vehicles were attacking them from all sides and it was vey hard to hit them back. After invading the north Nubans adapted the chariot and with their new found love for horse-breading became experts in the use of this wepon."
 nuban_path_3a:0 "The Feudal System"
 nuban_path_3a_desc:0 "Not all lands can be controlled directly. Especially when you have smaller population than the one you attempting to conquer. Thats why the tribal dependencies were adapted by the Nubans and turned into para-feudal system where vassla kings pay tributes in coin or soldiers. Vassal ruler can control his kinsmen better than distant monarch."
 nuban_path_1b:0 "Traditions"
 nuban_path_1b_desc:0 "Southerners have a lot of traditions and rituals connecting the community together. The tribal shamans fulfill especially important role by keeping the society cohesive and(with small monetary encouragement from king) obedient. Tribesmen that are raised in harsher conditions are better soldiers and because of that are important for the state."
 nuban_path_2b:0 "Elephants"
 nuban_path_2b_desc:0 "These monsters inhabiting the south are deffinately a sight to behold. They could be usefull in combat but they are still hard to control and probably a lot of time will pass before they will be safe to ride to battle. But beside this they can carry enormous amounts of supplies, the only downside is their apetite."
 nuban_path_3b:0 "Spear-thrower"
 nuban_path_3b_desc:0 "A quite specific wepon brought by the trade with the Iggigi from the south-western continent. It works pretty similarly to sling but instead of stone you have a short spear as a missile. Units equipped in such wepon wer present in many raids across the Barrim Wastes. Often the missiles are poisoned."
 nuban_path_1c:0 "Boats on the River"
 nuban_path_1c_desc:0 "Since the Nubans gained control over the lower Nissimu the boats raiding the coastal cities became a frequent sight. Raiders hide in reeds growing near the coast during the day and move silently during the night keeping the element of surprise. Since the long-boats can be carried on land raiders sometimes leave the river to run throu the desert."
 nuban_path_2c:0 "Southern Slave-Trade"
 nuban_path_2c_desc:0 "Thou it is sad for the Nubans slaves are the second most desired trade goods from the south. The main slave trading ceters are on the island called Gipeś by the Annunaki or Didombe(Black Pearl) by the locals. The strategic localisation of the island on a sea route to the Meluhha also helped in development of the local coast guard."
 nuban_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Warriors from the South"
 nuban_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Nubans are mostly victims of the enviroment in which the were forced to live in. The constant struggle with the Salgari invasions and slave raids conducted by their kinsmen forced them to adapt. They have a great potential boosted by their natural resources and caable warriors defending them."
