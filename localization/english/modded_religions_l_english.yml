 divineorder_pantheon:0 "Digir Zalag"
 desc_divineorder_pantheon:0 "Surprisingly the Devine Light, religion worshipped by Annunaki was never abandoned by the humans even after their rulers lost influence over the eastern continent. The religons symbol is the five-pointed star representing the Anu, main god of the pantheon and his servants. The worshippers believe that throu great deeds mortal can gain the favor of Anu and achieve divinity himself. The religion does not deny the existance of minor spirits or other dieties, but claims that Anu is the only one that can create true life."
 atun_pantheon:0 "Atenism"
 desc_atun_pantheon:0 "It may look weird at first that the inhabitants of the desert worship the Sun God but when you look closer sun is the most powerfull force in the land they inhabit. Aten do not have temples like other dieties but instead have sun altars on which the animals and in special cases humans are sacrificed to gain favor of their god. Outside of the Aten the inhabitants of the Galmus river believe in spirits called Gidim. Some of them are more powerfull than others and can aid the worshipper for a price. Their cult is tolerated by the priests unless they threten their position. "
 ancestors_pantheon:0 "Ancestral Cult"
 desc_ancestors_pantheon:0 "A traditional human religion. Believers claim that souls can aither reincarnate after death or choose to remain in the spirit world and support their families with their wisdom. Some spirits that lost their families and do not want to reincarnate can find a place where border between spirit world and mortal world is thinner and stay there. Such spirits can be helpful or harmfull but they rarely remember their who they were before they died. Usually human communities have priest or shaman that communicates with the spirits using their knowledge passed down from their predecessor."
 khorism_pantheon:0 "Eternal Sky"
 desc_khorism_pantheon:0 "The great spirit can be anybody. The traveling merchant a friend that do not remember talking to you a while ago or an unexpected guest. This is one of the reasons why the nomads are so friendly towards strangers, unless they are rich and poorly protected. Thats also why the guests and envoys cannot be harmed. When Gardu is asked what is their god original form they will always point the sky. The shamans will tell you that the Burkhan is everywhere and sees all. Thats why the horse lords believe that bloodless executions like strangulation are more honourable. "
 ancient_pantheon:0 "The Old Ones"
 desc_ancient_pantheon:0 "Ekimmu do not believe in gods. Yet they believe in oaths and keeping them thats why they decided to make a deal with the so called Old Ones. These spirits from the void in oposition to the dieties worshipped by other races are more willing to manifest themselves in the world of mortals. The price for their services is always the same. The biggest price anyone can pay. The life of a mortal. When Old One visits his worshippers he usually takes form of a twisted mass of tentacles. Their language may sound strange but it's largely because the words are not designed for humanoid speech apparatus. "
 slavic_pantheon:0 "Heresy"
