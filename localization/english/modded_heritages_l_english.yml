 #Modded Heritages
 anunnaki_heritage:0 "Anunnaki Heritage"
 anunnaki_heritage_desc:0 "Often called Enukku for convenience they are nearly immortal race of beings inhabiting the isle of Dilmun lying in the middle of a broken continent. After a devastating conflict with the Ekimmu they decided to abandone their empire on a eastern continent in favor of their sialnd refuge that is better protected from outside invasions. Currently they are the most civilised race on Tilasar. Their exile also forced them to develop their naval forces. Soon they may be able to take back their former territory."
 kengiri_heritage:0 "Kengiri Heritage"
 kengiri_heritage_desc:0 "One of more developed human nations inhabiting Dutugu. Their lands were mostly piecefullly evacuated thats why their memories from the times of Annunaki domination may be better than that of their neighbours. Thats also the reason why they kept their annunaki pantheon with Anu as their chief god. Their only waekness is their devided nature. The Kengiri city-states fought with each other since their masters left them two millenia ago. On the other hand that state of constant warfare changed them into the excellent warriors."
 salgari_heritage:0 "Salgari Heritage"
 salgari_heritage_desc:0 "The farmers living on the banks of the Nissimu river usually keep saying that their home is the gift from their god Aten. Their very name (people from the river banks) inherited from their masters is the testimony how gratefull they are for their fertile homeland. The Nissimu is the most regular river on continent so Salgari use the knowledge about the river floods to increase fertility of the land. As a result they are the most populous nation in the region. They are also known from their discipline (required to maintain the irrigation system) and their great monuments."
 ekimmu_heritage:0 "Ekimmu Heritage"
 ekimmu_heritage_desc:0 "Long lived race of grey skinned and bald subterrainean creatures. Two millenia ago they arrived on Nibiru on a interstellar ship and came into conflict with the annunaki and their human subjects after which they managed to force therm out of Dutugu. Yet the mysterious loss of their leader in a battle for Salgar created a divisions in their society which in turn prevented them from dominating the region. Today they are devided into clans living mostly in underground tunnels created during the conflict. Most of them live in Dead Hills where their ship originally crashed."
 nuban_heritage:0 "Nuban Heritage"
 nuban_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes called the First Humans. They inhabit in the southern part of the Dutugu and local islands. They live a tribal society and still believe in a traditional human faith. Acording to them human souls can stay in so called spirit world and aid their families with their wisdom. The community is led by shaman who is tasked with communicating the spirits of a tribe and banishing souls that haunt the living. The Nubans because of their backwardness suffered from constant slave raids, mainly from Salgari and the neighbourung Medded tribes."
 rabisu_heritage:0 "Rabisu Heritage"
 rabisu_heritage_desc:0 "Wepon Race as their creators call them. They were created by the Ekimmu for war with Annunaki. Ekimmu gave them larger strength and better immune system. Wounds that could kill a human for them are only a scratch. Initially they were never meant to be saintient but the clever Enukku gave them true life with the aid of their god Anu which in turn caused their revolt. Today they mostly inhabit the underground cave sustem under Dutugu. They never managed to create unified community and are still devided into clans."
 gardu_heritage:0 "Gardu Heritage"
 gardu_heritage_desc:0 "The Gardu tribes as their southern neighbours believe in one god Burkhan, also called a Sky God. The nomads from the central plains follow the strict code of honor like: guests and envoys cannot be harmed, word of a khan is law etc. These rules allow the hordes to cooperate in the enviroment where trust is hard to come by. The most important part of their culture however is the belief in so called Khan of Khans. A leader blessed by the Burkhan to lead the faithfull on the road to the world domination. Every khan secretly dreams of becoming the devine ruler."
 susigu_heritage:0 "Urtenite Heritage"
 susigu_heritage_desc:0 "The wolves from the north came to Kurgun recently and throu the contact with Kengiri they converted to the Devine Light of Anu. They were forced out of their homes by the other barbarians and to save their people they crossed the Kubad Mountains. They adopted many of the southern customs and the military organisation of Kengiri army. In their highly militarized culture the military service is seen as an honour and obligation. King can call one able bodied man from every household once per year for short period of time."
 sagentar_heritage:0 "Meded Heritage"
 sagentar_heritage_desc:0 "Meded and Salgari are two closely related nations. Homeland of the Meded tribes lies in the Barrim Watses to the south of Nissimu river. Their main source of income is the naval trade route to Meluha. Sometimes they also serve as guides and guardsmen for the merchants trying to avoid the taxes placed by the Salgarans. Ages ago they along with the Salgari overthrew the rule of shemsu-Hor (Annunaki) under the leadership of legendary king Scorpion. Similarly to the Gardu they respect the guest rights and envoys. They also treat their religion more seriously than their northern cusins."
