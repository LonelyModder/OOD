#sload_heritage_desc:0 "Living in the Archipelago between Yokuda and Tamriel Sloads are race of slug-like beings. Their most unique characteristic is complete lack of concience (or sense of justice and many other emotions). They can pretend for the sake of other races but they honor the deals only if they are beneficial to them ond not a moment longer. Sloads are very clumsy but also talented magically so they use undead and daedra in combat."
