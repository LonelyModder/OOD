 anunnaki_heritage_desc:0 "Often called Enukku for convenience they are immortal race of beings inhabiting the isle of Dilmun lying in the middle of a broken continent. After a devastating conflict with the Ekimmu they decided to abandone their empire on a eastern continent in favor of their sialnd refuge that is better protected from outside invasions. Currently they are the most civilised race on Tilasar. Their exile also forced them to develop their naval forces. Soon they may be able to take back their former territory."
 kengiri_heritage:0 "Kengiri Heritage"
 kengiri_heritage_desc:0 "One of more developed human nations inhabiting Dutugu. Their lands were mostly piecefullly evacuated thats why their memories from the times of Annunaki domination may be better than that of their neighbours. Thats also the reason why they kept their annunaki pantheon with Anu as their chief god. Their only waekness is their devided nature. The Kengiri city-states fought with each other since their masters left them two millenia ago. On the other hand that state of constant warfare changed them into the excellent warriors."
 salgari_heritage:0 "Salgari Heritage"
 salgari_heritage_desc:0 "The farmers living on the banks of the Nissimu river usually keep saying that their home is the gift from their god Aten. Their very name (people from the river banks) inherited from their masters is the testimony how gratefull they are for their fertile homeland. The Nissimu is the most regular river on continent so Salgari use the knowledge about the river floods to increase fertility of the land. As a result they are the most populous nation in the region. They are also known from their discipline (required to maintain the irrigation system) and their great monuments."
