 anunnaki_heritage_desc:0 "The Children of Anu as they call themselves do not come from this world. They came throu the Great Gate many eons ago along with their human slaves while the gates still worked. Thou they resemble humans they are stronger and faster than them. They also live far longer than men. Because the gate is on the isle of Dilmun they quickly became skilled sailors and their natural thirst for knowledge aided them in building the most advanced civilisation on Nibiru."
