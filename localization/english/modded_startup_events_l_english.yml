 nbw_startup.1.t:0 "Children of Anu"
 nbw_startup.1.desc:0 "The Anu's kin traveled to Nibiru throu the Gates. The Gates themselves are not their creation but they managed to use it to escape their dying world. No one exacly knows why their original homeland was destroyed but from the tales they passed on throu generations it looked like it was drained out of life. \n They never were the most populous race which was most likely connected to their incretibly long lifespans so with the aid of Anu they created humans out of local primates as a labour force. \n Everything changed in a Year of the Falling Star. The hordes of twisted beings attacked the Enukku strongholds and started poisoning everything they came in contact with. The Annunaki tried everything, every spell, every curse imaginable. Nothing worked until one day a proposition was made to defeat the enemy with a gift. For all that Annunaki knew the ekimmu leader controlled the Rabisu with piece of his own soul hidden within every green monstrousity. Without his will guiding them the enormous hordes will be harmless, so the solution seemed simple. With the blessing of Anu legions of Rabisu gained true life and free will. Then with all of aggression embued within them by Ekimmu they revolted against their masters. Plan seemed insane but worked perfectly, yet it was too little too late to and the Annunaki rule over the empire was lost forever. \n When first pharoh of the Salgari revolted the Annunaki decided to withdraw their forces from Dutugu Continent. Today Annunaki live in larger communities only on Dilmun and in a small colonies spread around the world. They managed to maintain their influences in the region of Kurgun mostly throu shared religion. Today Annunaki are defeated and scattered but they are still the most developed of the Nibiru races. "
 nbw_startup.1.a:0 "Will they reclaim their empire?"
 nbw_startup.2.t:0 "Monsters from the Depths"
 nbw_startup.2.desc:0 "Rabisu are the youngest of all the Nibiru's children. They were initially created as living war machines by Ekimmu to fight the annunaki and their human subjects all over the Dutugu where void worshippers first landed. When the tide seemed to turn in favor of the Ekimmu Annunaki decided to take the desperate measures and asked their god Anu for intervention. Anu responded by giving the Rabisu true life. Before they were living machines made for killing but with the gift of life they could gain their own will and with their naturally aggressive nature turn on their masters. The plot succeded and the Ekimmu offensive was stopped, but rabisu now out of control spread all around the Dutugu spreading death and destruction. \n The members of the race don't like the sunlight as their masters and often dwell in caves and mountains. They are stronger than humans and have stronger immune system. Contrary to a popular belief they do not have horns but from some reason like to wear them. Their society is devided into clans. It is known that they kept faith of their masters and still believe in the Old Ones. The rest of the races treat them with hostility. Rabisu are constantly trying to establish their own realm as far without results. It is very hard to avoid the infighting among numerous tribes."
 nbw_startup.2.a:0 "Maybe one day they will find leader worthy to unite them."
 nbw_startup.3.t:0 "The Void"
 nbw_startup.3.desc:0 "It is hard to explain what the void really is. It is not simply a parallel dimension like the hevens, hell or the realm of the spirits. It's space between them. It's where the worlds are born and the place where they die. When the ark of the ancestors landed on Nibiru Ekimmu as the locals called them were very fiew in nubmers and their enemies were stronger than anticipated. They could not depend on the mercy of the gods since they knew about their lies (gods feed on souls) so instead they made a deal with the first beings that responded to their calls for aid the Old Ones. They tought the Ekimmu how to draw power from the spirit realm and the void in ways even annunaki didn't knew about. Than they tought their now unknown leader, the Demon how to devide your soul into fragments and create Rabisu, monsters that could conquer the world for them. Than hubris took over and they believed themselves invincible, but Annunaki are old and cunning. No one expected that they will be able to overcome their distaste for Rabisu and give them true life. And now the Demon disappeared, Rabisu are out of control, and humans are spreading like rabbits using the power vacuum. \n Without the strong ruler to unite them the 12 clans spread around the Dutugu where they landed eachhaving their own ideas on how to defeat their enemies. Yet the things they learned cannot be so easily forgotten and their void dwelling benefactors are still with them. Maybe the dragons they tamed with the use of their powers are not the vast legions of rabisu but it is still a great wepon. Soon their enemies will learn to fear the darkness once more."
 nbw_startup.3.a:0 "They will bow or they will die."
 nbw_startup.4.t:0 "Grandchildren of Anu"
 nbw_startup.4.desc:0 "Kurgun looks like a natural fortress with Kubad (White Wall) Mountains as a defensive structure. Yet the very same mountains that prevent large invasions are also the perfect hideouts for Rabisu clans or even more deadly enemies.\n Despite this the relatively secure location and friendly relations with Annunaki living on the island not far from the coast enabled the Kenguru to develop rich and powerfull civilisation primarly based on commerce. For most of it's history Kurgun was devided on the city-states led by the so called ensi. Sometimes the more powerfull kings managed to unite the realm under their rule and claim the title of Lugal (Great Man). \n Surprisingly, Kingiri remained faithfull to the faith of their masters. Thats mainly thanks to the piecefull transfer of power between the humans and annunaki and the aid received by the abandoned city-states afterwards. Some jokingly suggest that cult of godess of love Lumma was also the factor. \n Recently the land was invaded by the Urtenite tribesmen. Converte recently to the true faith they challenged the rule of current lugal and under their new leader Annita march on Galkar. The Salgari to the south have their own internal struggle but when they will reunite they will have great resources of Nissimu river basin under their control. Than we will be in serious trouble."
 nbw_startup.4.a:0 "We just need to win than."
 nbw_startup.5.t:0 "Aten's Horizon"
 nbw_startup.5.desc:0 "The Nissimu river was treated as a bread basket by the Shemsu-Hor (local name for Annunaki). No one exacly know millenia later why local human tribes revolted but the conditions after the war and increased pressure on farm workers had to play a big role. All that we know is that one of the tribal leaders from upper Nissimu known today as Scorpion led an army of Salgari and Meded desert nomads on Menre where the Shemsu-Hor had their local capital. Since the enemy was vastly outnumbered they didn't put much of a fight. \n After revolution Scorpion clan established an empire centered around the Nissimu river that remained stable for centuries. The new ruler created a new title taking inspiration from Annunaki's governor palace, a Pharoh (literally meaning Great House). After couple centuries peoples started to believe that piece will last forever yet the direct line of Pharohs died out and cadet branches started fighting for the throne. \n Salgar is one of the most fertile regions of the continent and despite the internal struggle still have the great potential. Yet the enemies are not idle and the northerners busy with repelling barbarian invasion will not be ocupied forever. We also cannot forget about the Shemsu-Hor, their missionaries became active lately in the western regions of the Sahargal desert and we may be forced to invade their home island once we deal with other threats."
 nbw_startup.5.a:0 "Whatever will happen, Aten will guide us."
 nbw_startup.6.t:0 "Southlanders"
 nbw_startup.6.desc:0 "The dark skinned Nubans also known as elephant rieders rarely venture outside their homeland. Here the traditional beliefs survived to this day and shamans still commune with the ancestors. Also legends say that somewhere here the Annunaki had their laboratory where they created the humanity thou some suggest that it was placed on another world and Nub's Gate simply leads there. Whatever the case Nubans call themselves the First Man.\n Yet also the fact remains that due to the regions harsh climate and isolation (with the exception of the coasts) it is still a wilderness. Nubans are devided into clans which makes easy prey out of them and they often ane up as victims of the slave traders, mostly Medded tribesmen. \n Not all of Nubs inhabitants are so uncivilised as it looks at first glance. The Didombe isle in the south is the home to thriving community of traiders and pirates. It's strategic location aided in economic growth unprecedented in the region."
 nbw_startup.6.a:0 "Maybe there is hope for these tribes."
 nbw_startup.7.t:0 "Will of the Hevens"
 nbw_startup.7.desc:0 "Gardu, from east to west all nations under the sun tremble in fear hearing this name. Sometimes the invention of chariot is wrongly atributed to the annunaki but they are the real inventors and they are the best charioteers in the known world. The only thing preventing them for dominating the continent is their clan structure. Every horde is centered around the Khan, the local equivalent of king. after him are the leaders of the clans that joined earlier and below are the subjected tribes that were conquered later. \n The Gardan society is based primarly on clan relations and personal connections. Maybe this is the reason why the guest rights are so respected here. No one will be negotiating with the person who cannot be trusted as Gardu say. To some their unique execution methods like back breaking seem barbaric but it is the part of their religion. they believe that Sky god dilikes the sight of blood. The case of practical violence is the another thing entirelly. Gardu are not a large nation and they know it so they learned to use the practical violence to deal with the numerical advantage their enemies have. As their saying goes the enemy who ran away once will always see it as an option. They rarely place their own governors prefering to use local elites to better control the population."
 nbw_startup.7.a:0 "May the Burkhan grat them victory."
 nbw_startup.8.t:0 "Sands of Sahargal"
 nbw_startup.8.desc:0 "Led by their Sheikhs the clans of Barrim desert greatly profited from the trade routes passing throu their territory. Especially since the region of Nissimu river became unstable. The beduins know the desert and their inhabitants. Meded merchants are the intermediaries in the trade with Meluhha. The trade that brings the enormous amounts of imcome every year. It is not so weird than that all life is centered around it. \n The inhabitants of the Barrim Wastes are devided on the sendentary inhabitants of the coastal settlements and the nomads inhabiting the deserts. The first group partially adopted the faith in Anu and the Devine Light throu trade with Kingiri and the Dilmunite Annunaki while the second group ramained by the faith in Sun God Aten. \n The Meded have a unique form of inheritence believing that the oldest member of the tribe and the most experienced should inherit the leadership. Thats partially due to the fact that the sheikh is not only a secular position but also a religious one. Sheikh is the person leading all the most important religious celebrations. The proximity to the Nissimu's delta made it easy for the Mede to invade the fertile land in times of strife. And as this civil war unfolds, it is a period of confusion that a clever leader of a group of nomads could exploit before the Salgari are able to reunite."
 nbw_startup.8.a:0 "Will we take this opportunity?"
 nbw_startup.9.t:0 "Barbarians from the North"
 nbw_startup.9.desc:0 "Urtenites, in Enukku language the Cold Wolves, made an incursion into Kurgun quite recently. They are being pushed back from their original homeland along the coast north of White Wall Mountains. They easily adopted the Devine Light as their faith. Urtenites are a militarized society withere every member of the tribe is expected to learn to use spear and shield since he is strong enaugh to wield them. From participating in the Kingiri internal conflicts they learned the art of war and adapted a lot of their inventions like the siege engines and military formations. Initially they were employed as mercenaries but when they started to capture cities along the northern frontier the relations between the newcomers and locals reached the boiling point. None knows what caused the war but now their leader Annitas marches on the capital of Galkar with his tribal army atempting to become the new Lugal of Kurgun."
 nbw_startup.9.a:0 "Urteni on Kingiri throne. Let's hope so."
