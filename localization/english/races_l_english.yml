 annunaki_desc:1 "Short human term for Annunaki. In other words the children of Anu (the chief diety in most pantheons on Nibiru). From the human point of view annunaki are immortal but in reality their lifespans are hard to determine. They do not age like other beings since they are partially in the spirit dimension, as spirits they can die(or fade) when their will to live runs out. They were the first to arrive throu the Devine Gates. "
 human:0 "Human"
 human_desc:1 "The youngest race on Nibiru. Thou their priests often invent glorifying tales of their creation in reality they were made to be slaves to annunaki. Thats also the reason why they have genetic deseases like cancer. They also cannot cast spells (not because of lack of talent but biological cause) unless they have enukku or ekimmu among ancestors. They are the most common race on the planet."
 igigi:0 "Igigi"
 igigi_desc:1 "Reptilian race of humanoids native to Nibiru. It is rumored that in the past they ocupied the entire planet but due to the decreasing global temperature they had to retreat to the south. Arrival of the Enukku and Ekimmu might have been another cause. Initially the Annunaki used the technologically inferior reptiles as slaves but with the coming of man they were replaced by the humans."
 ekimmu:0 "Ekimmu"
 ekimmu_desc:1 "Grey skinned race of humanoids. Ekimmu prefer to live in their underground complexes. It is said that the tunnels spread under the entire eastern continent. They do not see the colors as other races and because of that their art focuses on sculptures. They do not live as long as annunaki but longer than other races (300 years more less). Since their mages take their power from the void they can prolong their lives."
 rabisu:0 "Rabisu"
 rabisu_desc:1 "Green skinned race of humanoids. Humans claim them to be demons from the underworld because they dislike the sunlight and as Ekimmu live mostly in underground complexes. Enukku claim that their enemies created them to combat Annunaki and their human subjects. With their tall stature and large muscles they easily outmatch any oponent on the battlefield. Their creators also gave them resistance to deseases."
